## About Callbreak:

Callbreak or Lakadi is a popular skill-based card game in South Asia, especially in India and Nepal. The objective of the game is to accurately predict the number of tricks (or hands) you will take in each round. It is played with a 52-card deck between 4 players with 13 cards each. In the standard version, there are five rounds, including 13 tricks in one round. For each deal, the player must play the same suit card. In this tash game, spades are the trump cards.
