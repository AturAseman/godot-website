In PVKK, you step into the role of a cannon pilot for an autocratic regime, confined to a defense bunker. Your mission: manually control a massive planetary defense cannon to fend off an ongoing interplanetary invasion. Master the various systems to protect your home world.

### Core Gameplay
Interact with a retro-tech cockpit filled with satisfying buttons, levers, dials, and switches. Manage energy generators, scan the skies for enemy vessels, analyze threats, calculate fire trajectories, and execute precise firing procedures. With limited resources and a strict regime, strategic thinking is key to your success.

### Progression and Upgrades
Between missions, maintain and improve your bunker, turning it into a comfortable and efficient retreat. Customize your space with earned resources to prepare for the next assault.

### Moral Dilemmas
Face tough choices that challenge your ethics and loyalty. Will you follow orders blindly, or will you question the regime's motives? How will you respond when someone from the outside shows you their truth? Your decisions shape the story and can lead to multiple endings in a world where everyone believes they are doing the right thing.

### Secrets of the Bunker
Your bunker hides secrets waiting to be discovered. Engage in escape room-style puzzles to uncover hidden items and clues about what is truly happening outside. The regime keeps you in the dark, feeding you half-truths and political euphemisms. Look behind these deceptions to understand the real situation and navigate the demands of the different factions in your own best interest.
