  text: "<p>I've been an advocate for open source software since I can remember, so Godot
  just seemed like the right fit. It's a good feeling knowing that my work isn't
  under the thumb of any kind of restrictive licensing.</p><p>
  I also liked the idea of being an early adopter at the time. There was buzz
  around the engine, but it still needs those flagship titles that people can
  point to. And that's really very important, because if people are asking 'how
  was this made' and the answer is something open source, that's a big
  accomplishment.</p><p>Something for me to aspire toward, anyway.</p>"

Between forgotten statues and newfound friends, find yourself in a relaxing getaway. Discover a secret garden and your role within it.

The Garden Path is a slice-of-life gardening sim that celebrates small moments. No matter how you decide to play, the garden is a tender world of familiar sights and sounds, mysteries, and friendly faces. A space to call your own, to curate, and to reflect.

### Wander in Your Own Time

Designed to be played in short bursts whenever you wish, time in The Garden Path runs in concert with the outside world. Following a mix of real-time and in-game time, the game will show you all four beautiful seasons in 28 real-world days, but each in-game day mirrors a 24-hour clock.

Stop by to wander your garden whenever the mood takes you and find new travelers, events, activities, and distractions waiting for you each day. Take your time, play for a little while, and witness how your Garden will grow and change over time.

### Meet a Charming Cast

You won’t be alone in your new home. A charming cast of vegetable-headed visitors are eager to make your acquaintance, and may even make their home alongside your own. Complete tasks for them, grow your bonds, and even compete in a friendly game of Conkers!

Over time, an endearing troupe of travelers will also come and go. Get to know Tabbal the grumpy Berber toad who only appears on a rainy day, Larto the musk ox with a penchant for song-fish, and many more. Traveling merchants will look to make trades with you for various useful items like seeds, decorative items, and tools.

### Enjoy the Look and Sounds of the Garden

With a unique hand-drawn aesthetic, The Garden Path’s stunning visual design embraces you from the start. Whether you want to design a cozy escape from reality with lush furniture items or expand your garden to new heights, decorating your Garden is completely up to you.

Let songs and sounds of nature find you, as you build a new haven in your own storybook-style garden. With two original scores, each unique to Night and Day, enjoy the Garden’s music whenever you play.

### Play with Friends

Every good Garden begs to be enjoyed with friends and family. Play The Garden Path with a second player in our local co-op mode! Just link up another controller (or share!) and enjoy wandering the Garden together.

Combine efforts by sharing an inventory and collecting harvestables to trade with traveling merchants. Enjoy your time together by using in-game emotes, and maybe even start a dance party in the process!
