Luck be a Landlord now has Screen Reader support! If the Screen Reader setting is enabled (under the Gameplay Settings or by holding the F3 key, 3 key, or L1 on a controller for 5 seconds), the game will output highlighted text to the operating system's clipboard. One can then use a screen reader program to read out the text from the clipboard. Using a Keyboard or Controller instead of a Mouse is ideal when using this mode.
