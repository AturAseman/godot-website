<p>
  <strong>A BRUTAL precision platformer where decapitation is just the beginning!</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Haiki is a diamond-hard platformer that rewards skilful play and punishes
  errors MERCILESSLY. Dive head-first into four worlds of colour-switching,
  laser-dodging, lightning-fast action.
</p>
<p>
  You control Haiki's severed head, on an epic journey to defeat the slash-happy
  Baron Nohead. Leap from wall-to-wall, across chasms, over spikes... into
  oblivion. You’ll need precision jumps and keen reactions to survive the 80
  hand-crafted levels standing between Haiki and victory.
</p>
<p>
  Die, die and die again until your reflexes are sharp enough to face the
  headless Baron and get your body back.
</p>
<p>
  Or lose your head forever.
</p>
<p>
  Want to get ahead? Get a hat! Collect dapper, dashing and dandy hats on your
  journey up from the gutter. How do the hats help Haiki on his quest?
</p>
<p>
  They don't. AT ALL.
</p>
<p>
  They're just hats.
</p>
