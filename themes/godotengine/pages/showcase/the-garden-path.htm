<p>
  The Garden Path is a sandbox gardening game. Players will emerge into a
  long-forgotten garden, and unlock tools to help shape the garden into
  something they can call their own.
</p>
<p>
  Depending on how the player chooses to grow their garden will decide who
  chooses to live there from a pool of many possible vegetable-headed
  inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
  Time in the The Garden Path is tied to real-time, but with seasons passing
  each week, and years passing each month. With each season comes new events,
  weather, and collectables that can be brewed into teas, or traded with a cast
  of animal travellers.
